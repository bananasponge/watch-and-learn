# WATCH AND LEARN
#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/Q4vsNIiifTY>
#### Description: A website to help Koreans learn English. More specifically, it analyzes TV shows' transcripts, lists the most commonly occurred words, allows the user to place words into flashcards and then to mark them as learned, and ultimately displays the user's progress per analyzed transcript.

#### Main Tools Used: Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask

#### 1. Folder ```static``` contains:
* ```favicon.ico``` — the website's favicon
* ```flashcard.png``` — the background to the carousel flashcards on page ```Focus```
* ```greencheck.png``` — the green check mark which appears on analyses pages if the word has already been marked ```Focus``` or ```Learned```
* ```loadingimage.gif``` — The Bee Movie GIF which appears while the algorithm is analyzing the user's input text
* ```logo.png``` — the brand logo on far left of navigation bar
* ```pagebg.jpg``` — the entire website's background, image symbolizing today's interconnectivity and globalism
* ```sorticon.png``` — the sort logo which appears on the far left of every table's header row, to let users know that each table is sortable by clicking on the relevant headers
* ```styles.css``` — the CSS file integrated in ```layout.html``` which extends to all HTML files

#### 2. Folder ```templates``` contains:
* ```analyze.html``` — HTML for page ```Analyze``` where users input the text from which they would like to generate a vocabulary list. The file also includes the HTML for its loading page when the algorithm is processing.
* ```analyzed.html``` — HTML for page ```Analyze``` which presents the results generated by the algorithm
* ```apology.html``` — HTML for error pages, e.g. no focus words found, wrong username/password, no history texts ran
* ```focus.html``` — HTML for flashcards and, below the flashcards, the list of words the user flagged ```Focus```
* ```guide.html``` — HTML for instructions on how to use ```Watch & Learn```
* ```history.html``` — HTML for listing out all the user's analyses ran and input text used, along with the option to click into each to retriece the previously generated results
* ```historyhome.html``` — HTML to retrieve the results of the specific input text the user chose/clicked on page ```History```
* ```index.html``` — HTML of homepage, summarizing what ```Watch & Learn``` is about and its inspiration
* ```layout.html``` — HTML containing navigation bar and footer for all pages; the layout extended to all other HTML files
* ```login.html``` — HTML for the login page
* ```progress.html``` — HTML listing out all the user's previous input texts and specific progress made based on words marked ```Learned```. Below the list of previous input texts is the list of all words marked ```Learned```.
* ```register.html``` — HTML to register for an account

#### 3. ```app.py``` — Python file used alongside Flask in order to run requests and generate results. Functions mainly include the algoritm to run on input texts (to generate vocabulary lists of most commonly used words); the SQL commands to keep a database of the user's input texts, ```Focus``` words, and ```Learned``` words; the calculations of the user's progress on each input texts based on ```Learned``` words

#### 4. ```helpers.py``` — Python file imported into ```app.py``` which includes the code for error pages (Bee meme) and login requirement

#### 5. ```requirements.txt``` — requirements file as stipulated by the Flask framework to list out all Python packages required to run the project

#### 6. ```watchnlearn.db``` — SQL database storing users' usernames, passwords, input texts, generated results, and record of ```Learned``` and ```Focus``` words. Three tables within this database:
* ```users``` — headers: user's ID, username, hashed password
* ```history``` — headers: general ID (sequential), user's ID, input text ID, input text name, the specific word's ID, the word itself, the word's Korean translation, how many times the word occurred, the percentage the word makes up in the entire input text, ```Focus``` flag, ```Learned``` flag
* ```text``` — headers: user's ID, input text ID, input text name, the input text itself
